This is for anyone completely new to algorithms. But it’s also been 20 years since I learned anything DS&A. I picked this book over others mostly on a whim, but being geared towards beginners, I was at least assured that the subject material would fly over my head. My complaint is against how the author chose to interject his explanation of the code. It just gave me a headache trying to parse code from comments. Then, once you’re done trying to find the code amongst the comments, realize it’s maybe 6 lines of code, he says, “This code is not trivial, so let’s break it down.” My feeling is that Ruby was the most represented of the three. All in all worth a read for the visualizations of the structures and algorithms. This book is the opposite, easy to read, by that I mean, concepts are explained in simple terms with walk through examples, along with visual examples, makes it easy to grasp, thus I now understand it, recursion now demystified, this book speaks my language,  highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you are starting out or looking for a primer. This book is perfect for someone like me who does not have a strong mathematics or computer science background. Even though most code is written in python, pearl, and JavaScript the code is readable to the point that you can comprehend the examples and can replicate them using your preferred programming language. By the way, I think step by step details were so good.
